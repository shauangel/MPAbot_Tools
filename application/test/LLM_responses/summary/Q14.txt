Document 0:
The document discusses the theoretical minimum number of comparisons needed to sort an array of n elements on average. It mentions that mergesort makes the lowest number of comparisons among standard comparison-based sorting algorithms. The recommendation is to use mergesort, specifically an adaptive variant like natural mergesort. It also suggests using insertion sort or heapsort for mostly sorted data or an optimal sorting network for small n values.
