1. **Document 2** (hopjfrd, Reddit): Provides in-depth explanation about classes, objects, and member functions in Python, which directly relates to using strings to call methods.
  
2. **Document 18** (Stackoverflow): Mentions the use of a dictionary, which is a common method to store and call functions/methods using strings.

3. **Document 0** (codeproject): Includes code examples demonstrating the creation of methods and calling them, indirectly related to using strings to call functions.

4. **Document 7** (Reddit): Explains the concept of bound methods and how functions/methods are called using dot notation, adding value to the understanding of calling methods with strings.

5. **Document 11** (Reddit): Discusses the difference between method calls and function calls in Python, providing clarity on the topic.

6. **Document 10** (Stackoverflow): Mentions the use of `getattr` and `operator.methodcaller`, which can be relevant when calling functions/methods dynamically using strings.

7. **Document 16** (Reddit): Talks about the relationship between objects, modules, and accessing attributes using dot notation, indirectly related to the topic.

8. **Document 9** (Reddit): Provides insights into Python's strong typing and the distinction between methods and functions, contributing to the understanding of calling methods with strings.

9. **Document 14** (Reddit): Explores the design decisions behind using methods for specific data types like strings, contributing to the comprehension of method calls.

10. **Document 12** (Stackoverflow): Suggests dictionary unpacking as an alternative to `eval`, which could be useful for dynamically calling functions/methods using strings.

11. **Document 13** (Reddit): Encourages building classes to understand method calls and the dot notation, indirectly related to the question asked.

12. **Document 15** (Stackoverflow): Mentions the use of `getattr` for accessing attributes, which can be applicable when dealing with function/method calls through strings.

13. **Document 17** (Reddit): Offers a more abstract view of objects and attributes in Python, which can aid in understanding how methods are accessed and called.

14. **Document 4** (codeproject): Provides a code snippet demonstrating property access and assignment, which is slightly related to calling functions/methods with strings.

15. **Document 1** (reddit): Discusses OOP and function/method paradigms, which although relevant, are less focused on the direct use of strings to call functions/methods.

16. **Document 6** (reddit): Explanations around calling object methods and functions, contributing to the overall understanding but not directly addressing calling methods with strings.

17. **Document 3** (reddit): Briefly mentions methods in the context of objects, adding a small piece to the understanding of method calls.

18. **Document 5** (codeproject): Mentions initializing values before calling methods, which is indirectly related to method calls with strings.

19. **Document 8** (reddit): Provides a simple explanation of function syntax and dot syntax, which is less specific to the topic of calling functions/methods with strings.

This ranking is based on the direct relevance and depth of information provided in each document regarding the use of strings to call functions/methods.
