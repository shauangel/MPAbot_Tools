Question: What is the difference between arguments and parameters?
Based on the relevance and depth of information provided in the documents, the following optimized ranking is suggested:

1. Document 9: A parameter is a variable in a method definition. When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters. (Stack Overflow)
2. Document 18: Parameters are the variables that accept within the function definition. Arguments are the values that pass into the function when it is called. (Stack Overflow)
3. Document 0: Explanation of how functions with parameters work internally and the benefits of using parameters. (CodeProject)
4. Document 1: Similar content to Document 0, explaining the concept of functions with parameters. (CodeProject)
5. Document 2: Another explanation of functions with parameters and how they work internally. (CodeProject)
6. Document 6: Discussion on the importance of using parameters in functions for versatility. (CodeProject)
7. Document 7: Emphasizes the significance of using parameters in functions for flexibility. (CodeProject)
8. Document 8: Talks about the advantages of using parameters in functions for versatility. (CodeProject)

10. Document 15: Discusses the use of optional parameters and method overloading in C# programming. (CodeProject)
11. Document 16: Similar content to Document 15, elaborating on optional parameters and method overloading in C# programming. (CodeProject)
12. Document 17: Additional information on optional parameters and method overloading in C# programming. (CodeProject)
13. Document 3: Mentions about the phrase "the best function are those without parameters" in the context of using classes. (CodeProject)
14. Document 4: Expands on the notion of functions without parameters in relation to classes and helper classes. (CodeProject)
