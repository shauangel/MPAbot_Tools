Question: How do I copy an object in Python?
I have analyzed the documents provided and optimized their ranking based on relevance to the question "How do I copy an object in Python?". Here is the updated ranking of the documents:

1. <<Document 1: , id: 4794254, source: stackoverflow>>To get a fully independent copy of an object you can use the copy.deepcopy() function. For more details about shallow and deep copying please refer to the other answers to this question and the nice explanation in this answer to a related question.
   
2. <<Document 6: , id: 48339768, source: stackoverflow>>Yes you can make a copy of class instance using deepcopy: This creates the copy of class instance 'c' in 'd'.
   
3. <<Document 15: , id: 40478341, source: stackoverflow>>If you want to create a copy of the class and assign that to a new object, you can use copy: Depending on the structure of your class, you may want to do a deepcopy instead. A shallow copy will only copy references to the objects found in your initial class. A deepcopy will attempt to recursively copy all objects within your original class.
   
4. <<Document 0: , id: 29398459, source: stackoverflow>>In general, you can use the copy module to produce copies of Python objects. copy.copy() will produce a shallow copy; a new instance is created but all attributes are simply copied over. If any of your attributes are mutable and you mutate those objects you'll see those changes reflected on both objects. copy.deepcopy() will produce a copy recursively; any mutable objects will themselves be cloned.

5. <<Document 9: , id: 72220352, source: stackoverflow>>You're right, using deepcopy from the built-in copy module is the way to go, since you want the exact replica of the Object Foo.

6. <<Document 10: , id: 244116, source: stackoverflow>>If your class does not modify __getitem__ or __setitem__ for special attribute access all your attributes are stored in __dict__ so you can do: If you use python properties you should look at inspect.getmembers() and filter out the ones you want to copy.

7. <<Document 12: , id: 42143502, source: stackoverflow>>If you want to make a copy then one way is using deepcopy: All = does is to assign another reference to the same object in memory. The deepcopy creates a whole new object in memory with the values of A and B will reference it.

8. <<Document 4: , id: 45765979, source: stackoverflow>>Your copy() method copied the copy method (not the function from the class) from test1, which means that self in test2.copy() is still test1.

9. <<Document 7: , id: 244654, source: stackoverflow>>Try destination.__dict__.update(source.__dict__).

10. <<Document 11: , id: 46939443, source: stackoverflow>>So, if I change values of the fields of the new object, the old object should not be affected by that. You mean a mutable object then.

These documents provide relevant information about copying objects in Python, including the usage of `copy.deepcopy()` and considerations for shallow and deep copying.
