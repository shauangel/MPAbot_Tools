Question: I want to do a complicated sort: can you do a Schwartzian Transform in Python?
Based on the content of the documents, here is a suggested ranking for the documents regarding the topic "Schwartzian Transform in Python":

1. **Document 4**: This document directly addresses the Schwartzian Transform in Python and provides a clear explanation of how it can be used to sort items efficiently.
   
2. **Document 0**: Although the document discusses general sorting algorithms, it mentions the Schwartzian Transform as a technique to reduce any sorting problem to sorting integers.
   
3. **Document 1**: While the document primarily focuses on Python's guidelines for methods, it briefly touches upon the history of sorting algorithms in Python and the introduction of the key parameter to support the Schwartzian Transform.
   
4. **Document 5**: This document mentions the `sorted()` function and the use of `operator.itemgetter`, which can be relevant in the context of the Schwartzian Transform.
   
5. **Document 8**: The document discusses sorting algorithms that minimize the number of comparison operations, which could be indirectly related to the Schwartzian Transform.
   
6. **Document 2**: The document talks about traditional sorting methods and the importance of comparisons in sorting, which provides a general background for understanding sorting techniques like the Schwartzian Transform.
   
7. **Document 3**: While the document mentions lexicographic sorting, it does not directly relate to the Schwartzian Transform or its implementation in Python.
   
8. **Document 6**: The document discusses sorting algorithms that minimize the number of comparison calls, which can be relevant but does not directly address the Schwartzian Transform.
   
9. **Document 7**: The document discusses shuffling algorithms rather than sorting algorithms, so it is less relevant to the topic of Schwartzian Transform in Python.
   
10. **Document 9**: The document discusses new sorting algorithms for small lists but does not directly address the Schwartzian Transform or its implementation in Python.
   
11. **Document 10**: The document briefly mentions the Schwartzian Transform in relation to Perl programming, but it does not provide detailed information on its implementation in Python.
   
12. **Document 11**: The document discusses Haskell and the Schwartzian Transform, which may not be directly relevant to the Python implementation.
   
13. **Document 12**: This document mentions the connection between Conjugate Transforms and the Schwartzian Transform, which provides some context but is not detailed.
   
14. **Document 13**: The document talks about sorting strings based on their length, which is not directly related to the Schwartzian Transform in Python.
   
15. **Document 14**: The document discusses shuffling algorithms and their biases, which is not directly related to the Schwartzian Transform in Python.
   
16. **Document 15**: The document discusses the syntax and functionality of the `sorted()` function in Python, which can be relevant to understanding the Schwartzian Transform.
   
17. **Document 16**: The document discusses Google Docs and PDF files, which are not directly related to the topic of Schwartzian Transform in Python.
   
18. **Document 17**: The document provides examples of using the `sorted()` function with key functions, which is relevant to understanding the Schwartzian Transform.
   
19. **Document 18**: The document discusses shuffling arrays and the Big O notation, which, while related to sorting algorithms, is not directly about the Schwartzian Transform in Python.
