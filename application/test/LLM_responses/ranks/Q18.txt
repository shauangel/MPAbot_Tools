Question: When I edit an imported module and reimport it, the changes donâ€™t show up. Why does this happen?
After analyzing the content of the provided documents, I would suggest the following optimized rank for these documents based on relevance and quality:

1. **Document 0 (Stackoverflow, id: 25866649)** - This document provides a direct solution to the issue by suggesting the use of `importlib.reload` to explicitly reload the module. It directly addresses the problem and offers a clear solution.

2. **Document 5 (Stackoverflow, id: 21965170)** - This document also provides a detailed explanation of how module reloading works in Python, emphasizing that reloaded modules retain their dictionary and bindings. It offers valuable insights into the behavior of module reloading.

3. **Document 7 (Stackoverflow, id: 684186)** - This document provides an update for Python 3 regarding the `reload` function, highlighting the deprecation of `imp` in favor of `importlib`. It offers relevant information for users targeting Python 3 or later versions.

4. **Document 8 (Reddit, id: kuwk6sd)** - This document mentions the usage of `importlib.reload()` for reloading modules in Python, especially useful for scenarios like executing code in notebooks without restarting the kernel. It offers a practical solution to the problem.

5. **Document 13 (Stackoverflow, id: 29296139)** - This document addresses the issue of changes not reflecting due to Python's module caching behavior. It suggests using `reload` after importing the module as a workaround to force a reload explicitly.

6. **Document 10 (Reddit, id: iazccvs)** - This document introduces the IPython extension `autoreload` as a solution for tracking changes in a module in an IPython shell or Jupyter notebook. It provides an alternative approach to handle module reloading dynamically.

7. **Document 1 (Reddit, id: go7lb3i)** - Although this document discusses namespace issues related to importing modules, it provides additional information that may not directly address the main issue of changes not reflecting after reimporting a module. It offers some insights on optimizing memory usage and namespace management.

8. **Document 2 (Reddit, id: jmv0v8m)** - This document discusses the execution of code in modules when imported and provides insights on controlling code execution using `if __name__ == "__main__"`. While it offers valuable information, it may not directly address the main issue of changes not reflecting after reimporting a module.

9. **Document 4 (Reddit, id: c883cpo)** - This document mentions the `reload()` function in Python and discusses scenarios where reloading a module may be necessary. It also addresses related questions about fixing errors in code.

10. **Document 15 (Reddit, id: jmvaq6k)** - This document highlights the potential complexities that can arise from running code in Python files and emphasizes the need to consider the entire file due to possible conflicts like function redefinitions.

11. **Document 11 (Reddit, id: iax7k4e)** - This document discusses the importance of clear imports in Python code to maintain readability and avoid namespace pollution. It provides insights into choosing between different import styles based on the context.

12. **Document 18 (Reddit, id: iayxvgo)** - This document humorously showcases unconventional import practices in Python, adding a light-hearted perspective to the discussion on imports and namespaces.

13. **Document 3 (Reddit, id: go7jcic)** - This document addresses concerns about importing the same library multiple times in Python and clarifies how Python optimizes this process efficiently. It provides context on Python's handling of multiple imports.

14. **Document 12 (Stackoverflow, id: 64166391)** - This document introduces the IPython extension `autoreload` for tracking changes in a module dynamically, offering an alternative approach to handle module reloading in an IPython shell or Jupyter notebook.

15. **Document 9 (Reddit, id: jmv1bwq)** - This document explains the necessity of running the entire file when importing a module due to potential dependencies within the module. It offers insights into why running the entire file may be required.

16. **Document 6 (Reddit, id: iaxf71s)** - This document discusses the behavior of module loading in Python and how the entire module is loaded irrespective of the import style. It provides a general overview of module loading in Python.

17. **Document 19 (Reddit, id: iay4sgd)** - This document shares a personal preference for avoiding imports that are not modules to maintain clear namespaces in Python code. It offers a perspective on namespace management.

18. **Document 16 (Reddit, id: go7jtli)** - This document briefly addresses the need for directives in Python code, indicating that Python rarely requires such directives. It provides a succinct response to a specific question.

19. **Document 17 (Reddit, id: iaye7pt)** - This document discusses the benefits of selective imports in Python to avoid namespace clutter and maintain code clarity. It provides examples and suggestions for optimizing imports in Python code.

20. **Document 14 (Reddit, id: iay5nl9)** - This document explains the concept of aliasing in Python imports to avoid namespace pollution and clarifies the impact of different import methods on the program's namespace. It focuses on maintaining a clean namespace.

These rankings are based on the relevance of the content to the main issue of changes not reflecting after reimporting a module, the quality of the solutions or explanations provided, and the overall impact on understanding and addressing the problem effectively.
